Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The Affero GPL is similar to the ordinary GPL, but it has an additional
term to ensure that users who interact with the licensed software over a
network can receive the source for that software.
